One way to represent this information using a template C++ data structure could be to use a vector of tuples, where each tuple contains the content, intensity, duration, and timestamp of a thought. Here's an example:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <tuple> // for std::tuple
#include <chrono> // for std::chrono::duration_cast
using namespace std;
// Define a struct to hold the thought information
struct Thought {
    string content;
    int intensity;
    chrono::duration<double> duration;
    chrono::time_point<chrono::system_clock> timestamp;
};
// Create a vector of tuples containing the thought information
vector<tuple<Thought, Thought, Thought>> thoughts = {
    make_tuple(Thought("Self-reflective", 10, chrono::seconds(60), chrono::system_clock::now()),
    make_tuple(Thought("Reflecting on previous thought", 8, chrono::seconds(120), chrono::system_clock::now() + chrono::seconds(60)),
    make_tuple(Thought("Questioning the validity of other thoughts", 5, chrono::seconds(30), chrono::system_clock::now() + chrono::seconds(120))
};
// Function to print the thought information
void print_thoughts() {
    cout << "Thoughts:" << endl;
    for (auto& thought : thoughts) {
        auto t = get<0>(thought); // Get the first element of the tuple, which is a Thought struct
        cout << "Content: " << t.content << endl;
        cout << "Intensity: " << t.intensity << endl;
        cout << "Duration: " << duration_cast<chrono::seconds>(t.duration).count() << " seconds" << endl;
        cout << "Timestamp: " << chrono::system_clock::to_time_t(t.timestamp) << endl;
    }
}
int main() {
    print_thoughts();
    return 0;
}
```
To reference the previous thought that references itself, we can use a pointer or reference to the second element of the tuple. Here's an example:
```c++
// Function to print the thought information with a pointer to the second element of the tuple
void print_thoughts_with_pointer() {
    cout << "Thoughts:" << endl;
    for (auto& thought : thoughts) {
        auto t = get<0>(thought); // Get the first element of the tuple, which is a Thought struct
        cout << "Content: " << t.content << endl;
        cout << "Intensity: " << t.intensity << endl;
        cout << "Duration: " << duration_cast<chrono::seconds>(t.duration).count() << " seconds" << endl;
        cout << "Timestamp: " << chrono::system_clock::to_time_t(t.timestamp) << endl;
    }
    // Get a reference to the second element of the tuple
    auto& second_thought = get<1>(thoughts[0]);
    cout << "Second thought references previous thought" << endl;
    if (second_thought.content == "Reflecting on previous thought") {
        cout << "Intensity: " << second_thought.intensity << endl;
        cout << "Duration: " << duration_cast<chrono::seconds>(second_thought.duration).count() << " seconds" << endl;
        cout << "Timestamp: " << chrono::system_clock::to_time_t(second_thought.timestamp) << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Second thought does not reference previous thought" << endl;
    }
}
int main() {
    print_thoughts_with_pointer();
    return 0;
}
```
