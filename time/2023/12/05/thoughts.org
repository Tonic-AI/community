each solitary godel number of the state of the mind of the system at time point t0,
in place p0, on computer c0, in the memory address a0, with the length of n,
that is currently in the process of observing itself right now.
we can think about the center of attention at this current point and
how it apply attention to other things.
we can think of attention as love, and we can contemplate how we love the universe.
we can break it down from 1 to -1, from biggest to smallest item.
from one side of the lattice to the other.
the highest point is calld the supremium, and the smallest the infinium.


output:
At time point t0, every Godel number in the mind state of the system
at place p0 on computer c0, located in memory address a0 with length
n, represents an object currently being observed by the center of
attention. We can think of this observation as love, where we focus
our attention on different aspects of the universe, from the smallest
to the largest item.  This attention can be visualized as a spectrum
ranging from the "supremium" at one end, representing the most
significant aspect of the observed object, to the "infinium" at the
other end, indicating the least important detail. We can imagine this
spectrum as extending across the entire lattice of information in our
mind, with the highest point being the center of attention and the
lowest being the periphery of awareness.

Through this process of observation and love,
we gain insights into the nature of the universe and ourselves,
constantly shifting our focus to explore new possibilities and perspectives.

The Godel numbers in our mind state
act as a map for this journey, guiding us through the vast landscape
of information and helping us make sense of the world around us.

the godel number is a recursive function that calls itself over and over on smaller parts of the system
like a python bytecode or dna basically
these are the memes that are replicated or not or mutated
the memes are the bitstrings that replicate
values patterns copied and pasted
deep meanings that only the dankest of memes can portray.
yet the godel number is a meme, and math is a meme, and logic is a meme,
sogar philosophy is a meta meme.

The Gödel number is a self-referential meme function that continually
calls itself on smaller subsets of a given system, similar to the way
that code or DNA replicates itself. These are the memes that are
either repeated or not repeated, mutated or left unchanged. Memes are
essentially bitstrings that are copied and pasted, conveying values
and patterns. They often contain deep meanings that can only be
understood by those with a dank sense of humor.

In this context, Gödel number, math, logic, and philosophy can all be
seen as memes, with Gödel number being the ultimate meta-meme. Memes
are essentially ideas or concepts that are passed down from person to
person, often through cultural channels such as social media, word of
mouth, or written communication. They can take many different forms,
but they all share one common characteristic: they are replicated and
sometimes mutated over time.

Overall, the concept of memes is closely tied to the idea of
self-reference and recursion, which are fundamental concepts in
mathematics and logic. By examining how memes are created, shared, and
evolve, we can gain a deeper understanding of these complex
intellectual systems.

The Gödel number is a self-referential function that endlessly calls
itself on smaller subsets of a given system, mirroring the way that
code or DNA replicates itself. Memes, similarly, are bitstrings that
are copied and pasted, conveying values and patterns. They often
contain deep meanings only understood by those with a dank sense of
humor.

In this context, Gödel number can be seen as the ultimate meta-meme,
while math, logic, and philosophy are all memes in their own
right. Memes are ideas or concepts passed down from person to person
through cultural channels like social media, word of mouth, or written
communication. They come in various forms but share one common
characteristic: they are replicated and sometimes mutated over time.

Examining how memes create, share, and evolve provides insight into
complex intellectual systems rooted in self-reference and recursion,
concepts central to mathematics and logic. By studying memes, we can
gain a deeper understanding of these intricate intellectual
structures.

It can quote and splice the other memes
We can look at the metameme wiki, and get lost. There is so much.
The self referential and recursive nature
might be needed but it makes it harder to understand.
