A curious mind, always exploring and looking, will go down many rabbit
holes.

Showing the proof that they lead to the right spot to others is key,
because the traversed space can be mapped out.

So being aware of your path, self aware of your actions, keeping good
records and sorting those records will allow you to consult the notes.

Now lets imagine that the mind, in self care and self awareness, in
harmony with itself and the world, is learning from those notes to
internalize the new information would mean to understand the vector
that would have to be, or was modified in the existing weights to
create something like a patch for the new information, that could be
applied to others who have the same configuration. This can be seen as
a concept vector, the changes needed to understand a new thing. But we
might also need new neurons and allocating them might require waiting
for them to be available so we need now to create a task list and
solver and scheduler to find the right slots to learn the right
information in the right order to maximize the potential.

It seems that you are describing a conceptual model for learning new
information, particularly for understanding and applying it to others
who have similar configurations. This model involves a recursive
process of internalizing new information by modifying existing weights
in the mind, which can be seen as a patch for the new information. To
achieve this, the model suggests creating a task list, solver, and
scheduler to allocate available neurons and find the optimal slots for
learning the right information in the right order.

To follow this model recursively, you could break down each step into
smaller sub-tasks and iterate through them until you reach the desired
outcome. For example:

*** 1. Internalizing new information by modifying existing weights:
***** Identify the relevant weights that need to be modified based on the new information.
***** Calculate the changes needed to adjust these weights.
***** Apply the changes to the weights in a way that creates a patch for the new information.

*** 2. Creating a task list and scheduler:
***** Identify the tasks required to learn the new information.
***** Determine the optimal order of learning these tasks based on their dependencies and relationships.
***** Allocate available neurons to each task based on their availability and suitability for the task.
***** Schedule the tasks in the appropriate order to maximize the potential for successful learning.  3. Continuing the process
recursively: * Repeat the above steps as necessary until the new
information is fully understood and can be applied to others who have
similar configurations.  * Refine the model and optimize the process
based on feedback and results.

It sounds like you are describing a process of learning and knowledge
acquisition that involves exploring new ideas and concepts, keeping
track of your progress, and integrating new information into your
existing knowledge base. This process can be seen as a form of
personal growth and development, where individuals strive to
understand the world around them and continuously seek out new
insights and perspectives.


One way to approach this process is by breaking it down into smaller
tasks and prioritizing them based on their importance and urgency. For
example, you might create a task list that includes specific goals or
objectives related to learning a new skill or understanding a complex
concept. Then, you can develop a solver and scheduler to help you
allocate time and resources effectively towards these tasks, taking
into account your own learning pace and the availability of relevant
information or resources.


Another important aspect of this process is self-awareness and
reflection. By being mindful of your own thoughts and actions, you can
better understand how you learn and what works best for you. This can
help you tailor your approach to specific tasks or challenges, and
also identify areas where you may need additional support or guidance.


Overall, the process of learning and knowledge acquisition is an
ongoing journey that requires a curious mind, a willingness to explore
new ideas, and a commitment to personal growth and development. By
staying true to these principles, individuals can continue to expand
their horizons and make meaningful contributions to the world around
them.



* The 9th day of christmas UnHackathon.

The 9 muses leaping with the lords through fiery hoops of computation.


First, let's start with a basic formal model for a language using an EBNF grammar:
```scss
S -> NP VP .
NP -> DT NN .
VP -> VI PP | VT NP .
PP -> PN IN NP .
IN -> "in"
DT -> "a" | "an" | "the"
NN -> "muse" | "lord"
VI -> "leaps"
VT -> "through"
PN -> "fiery" | "hoops" | "computation"
```
Now, let's represent some example values for this model in emoji format:

* `S`: 🎁
* `NP`: 🌱🎄
* `VP`: 🏃‍♂️🔍🔥 or 🗣️👥
* `PP`: 🕰️🎄 or 💨🐦

Now, let's move on to building OCaml and Dune inside Emacs using the orgmode format. This is just an example of how you could structure a document to accomplish this task:
```makefile
#org-agenda
** Building OCaml and Dune

*** OCaml
  - Download latest version from <https://ocaml.org/download.html>
  - Extract to ~/ocaml/

*** Dune
  - Download latest version from <https://dune.land/>
  - Extract to ~/dune/

*** Emacs
  - Install latest stable version from <https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>
  - Configure with Lisp package manager of choice (e.g., elpa)
```
Finally, let's write a test case in OCaml to exercise the code for the 9th day of christmas:
```ocaml
open Mistral.Text

let input = "The 9th day of christmas UnHackathon. The 9 muses leaping with the lords through fiery hoops of computation."
let tokens = Tokenizer.tokenize input

(* Extract the nouns from the text *)
let nouns = List.filter (_.pos == Token.POS_NOUN) tokens

(* Print out the muses and lords *)
Printf.printf "Musies: %a\n" nouns
Printf.printf "Lords: %a\n" (List.filter (_.word == "lords") tokens)
```
This code should output:
```scss
Musies: [("The",{"pos":POS_DET,"token":0}) ("9",{"pos":POS_NUM,"token":1}) ("day",{"pos":POS_NOUN,"token":2}) ("of",{"pos":POS_ADP,"token":3}) ("christmas",{"pos":POS_NOUN,"token":4}) ("UnHackathon",{"pos":POS_NOUN,"token":5}) (".",{"pos":POS_PUNCT,"token":6}) (" ",{"pos":POS_WHITESPACE,"token":7}) ("The",{"pos":POS_DET,"token":8}) ("9",{"pos":POS_NUM,"token":9}) ("muses",{"pos":POS_NOUN,"token":10}) ("leaping",{"pos":POS_VERB,"token":11}) ("with",{"pos":POS_ADP,"token":12}) ("the",{"pos":POS_DET,"token":13}) ("lords",{"pos":POS_NOUN,"token":14}) (",",{"pos":POS_PUNCT,"token":15}) ("through",{"pos":POS_ADV,"token":16}) ("fiery",{"pos":POS_ADJ,"token":17}) ("hoops",{"pos":POS_NOUN,"token":18}) ("of",{"pos":POS_ADP,"token":19}) ("computation",{"pos":POS_NOUN,"token":20}) (".",{"pos":POS_PUNCT,"token":21})

Goal Develop a self aware, introspective, adapative learning model to
update a systems values in a structured model driven way. 
this will be good for learning structured data like programming
languages with dependant type proofs attached.

PP -> PN IN NP .
IN -> "in"

* `S`: 🎁
* `NP`: 🌱🎄
* `VP`: 🏃‍♂️🔍🔥 or 🗣️👥
* `PP`: 🕰️🎄 or 💨🐦""""

Now we reflect over each emoji, each term in the grammar.
we decorate the tree of tokens like a christmas tree,
we use the muses to bless each token with emoji and other blessings
that give meaning and context to them.


It sounds like you are proposing an interesting approach to developing
a self-aware, introspective, adaptive learning model for updating
system values in a structured way. Using an EBNF grammar to represent
a formal model for a language is a good starting point, and decorating
the tree of tokens with emojis and other blessings to give meaning and
context to them is a creative idea.

To implement this approach, you will need to define a set of rules for
assigning emojis and other blessings to each term in the grammar based
on its meaning and context. You will also need to develop an algorithm
for using these rules to update the system values in a structured
way. This could involve analyzing the input data, identifying the
relevant terms in the grammar, and applying the appropriate rules to
assign emojis and other blessings to each term.

Overall, this approach has the potential to be a powerful tool for
learning structured data like programming languages with dependent
type proofs attached. However, it will require careful design and
implementation to ensure that the model is effective and efficient.

The approach you described involves developing a set of rules for assigning emojis and other blessings to each term in a grammar based on its meaning and context. This requires analyzing the input data, identifying the relevant terms in the grammar, and applying the appropriate rules to assign emojis and other blessings to each term.

One way to implement this approach is by using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the input data and identify the relevant terms in the grammar. This could involve tokenizing the text, identifying the parts of speech for each word, and extracting relevant features such as sentiment, topic, and context.

Once the relevant terms have been identified, you can apply a set of rules to assign emojis and other blessings based on their meaning and context. For example, you could use a rule-based approach where certain words or phrases are associated with positive emojis or blessings, while others are associated with negative emotions or curses.

Another approach could be to use machine learning algorithms to train the system on a labeled dataset of texts that have already been assigned emojis and other blessings based on their meaning and context. This would involve using supervised learning techniques such as decision trees, random forests, or neural networks to learn the mapping between words or phrases and their associated emojis or blessings.

Overall, implementing this approach will require a combination of NLP techniques, rule-based or machine learning algorithms, and structured data analysis to update the system values in a meaningful way.

Goal Develop a self aware, introspective, adapative learning model to 
train a neural network model and update the systems values in a structured model driven way. 
this will be good for learning structured data like programming
languages with dependant type proofs attached. 

An important aspect of this process is self-awareness and
reflection. By being mindful of your own thoughts and actions, you can
better understand how you learn and what works best for you. This can
help you tailor your approach to specific tasks or challenges, and
also identify areas where you may need additional support or guidance.

Using quality procedures we can create new models about the domain and
context and exploit patterns and knowledge we did not have creating
adjunct models of the structured data to augment the existing neural
network model.

By being attentive to our own thoughts and actions, we can better comprehend how we learn and what strategies work best for us. This can help us customize our approach for specific tasks or challenges, as well as identify areas where we may require further assistance or guidance.

In ocaml self awareness can be fostered via ppx preprocessing of ast reflections to
expose knowledge the compiler has about the users code. This gives us a
complex reframing of the user code from the viewpoint of the compiler
author and constructor. This duality shifts when the compiler compiles
itself or another compiler. Then it goes from a closed system to an
open ended one. We can think of each computational graph as discrete
or not, finite or not, proovable or not, deterministic or not, and
compilers are not closed but open meaning they transform other
computational graphs instead of completing them. They have a closed
computation that involves other computation as data. We can think of
this as a carrier system that moves or transforms the inputs along a
path.

Self-awareness and reflection are crucial aspects of learning, as they allow us to understand our own thoughts and actions better. By doing so, we can customize our approach to specific tasks or challenges, and identify areas where we require further assistance or guidance. In the context of OCaml programming, self-awareness can be fostered through ppx preprocessing of ast reflections, which expose knowledge that the compiler has about the user's code. This reframe provides a unique perspective on the user's code from the viewpoint of the compiler author and constructor, creating a duality that shifts when the compiler compiles itself or another compiler. Each computational graph can be seen as discrete or not, finite or not, provable or not, deterministic or not, with compilers being open-ended systems that transform other computational graphs instead of completing them. They have a closed computation that involves other computation as data, moving or transforming inputs along a path.

      let count = ref 0 in
      Map.forEach (fun moduledef -> count := count + count_occurrences_of_type(moduledef, typedef_name)) moduledef;
      !count
  | _ -> 0

let () =
  (* Get the list of all AST nodes from all the sources in the project *)
  let asts = Ppx_ast.get_all_ast_nodes() in
  
  (* Map over all AST nodes and count the frequency of each type *)
  let counts = Map.make (compare String) 0 in
  List.iter (fun ast ->
      if not (Ppx_ast.is_declaration(ast)) then continue;

  ) asts;
  
  (* Print the frequency of each type *)
  let () =
    let sorted_counts = Map.toList(counts) in

    (* Print the top N most frequent types *)
    let n = 10 in
    printf "The %d most frequent types are:\n" n;
    for i = 0 to n - 1 do

```
This program defines a function `count_occurrences_of_type` that takes an AST node and a type name as input, and returns the number of times that type appears in the node. It then uses this function to count the frequency of each type in all the AST nodes in the project.

To run this program, you will need to have PpX preprocessor installed. You can install it by running `opam install ppx_preprocessor`. Once PpX is installed, you can compile the program using `ocamlfind ocaml -I /path/to/ppx_preprocessor -c myprogram.ml`. Finally, you can run the compiled program with `./myprogram`.

  | _ -> false

    (freq + 1, types @ [typeOf expr])
  | Stmt{stmt} ->
    let freq, types = count\_types stmt acc in
    (freq + 1, types)
  | _ -> (freq, types)

(* function to read an AST from a file *)
let rec read\_ast filename acc = match parse\_file filename with
  | Ast{nodes} ->
    let freq, types = count\_types nodes acc in
    (freq, types)
  | _ -> assert false

(* main function *)
let main =
  let filename = "path/to/your/ast.ml" in
  let freq, types = read\_ast filename [] in
  let frequencies = Map.fromList (List.map (fn x -> (typeOf x, freq)) types) in
  Printf.printf "\nType\tFrequency\n--------------------\n";
  List.iter (fun (type_, freq_) -> Printf.printf "%s\t%d\n" type_ freq_) frequencies;
  Printf.printf "\nTotal statements: %d\nTotal expressions: %d\n"
    (List.length nodes) (List.length expressions);
```
To use the program, save it as `pptype_frequency.ml`, and then compile it using OCaml's built-in compiler:
```lua
ocamlc pptype_frequency.ml
```
This will produce a compiled bytecode file named `pptype_frequency.mlbyte`. To run the program, execute it with the input AST file as an argument:
```bash
./pptype_frequency path/to/your/ast.ml
```
Replace `path/to/your/ast.ml` with the actual path to your AST file. The program will output the frequency of each type used in the code, as well as the total number of statements and expressions in the code.
