org-babel block script to execute python

keras module to capture the results of matrix multiplications from another process
and it trys to predict the next vector.
the most common vector size is 4096 floats so we can start with that as our size and truncate or pad the other sized vectors into that .

#+begin_src python
  import keras
  from keras.layers import Dense
  from keras.models import Sequential
  from keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

  # assume you have two matrices A and B of size 4096x1 and 1x4096 that are multiplied together
  A = np.random.randn(4096, 1)
  B = np.random.randn(1, 4096)
  C = np.matmul(A, B)

  # create a keras model to predict the next vector in the sequence
  model = Sequential([
      Dense(256, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
      Dense(256, activation='relu'),
      Dense(4096, activation='linear')
  ])
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

  # pad the matrices A and B to size 4096x1
  A_padded = pad_sequences([A], maxlen=4096, padding='post')
  B_padded = pad_sequences([B], maxlen=4096, padding='post')

  # concatenate the padded matrices and create a numpy array to pass to the model
  X = np.concatenate([A_padded, B_padded])
  y = C[:, 0]

  # predict the next vector in the sequence
  prediction = model.predict(X)
