* autocomplete task.

create program that can rewrite itself with ai,
complete the uncompleted sections,
and regenerate the old ones exactly, unless agreed upon.

We have test cases, because we have a running program, we can extract the structure.

ppx reflection runs at compile time,
to inspect the bytecodes of the modules compiled,

inside of the running program, at runtime we can use ppx reflection indirectly
so, at compile time, use ppx to produce functions that are called
and used at runtime to collect data.
